After working as a bartender for nine years while doing some programming in my spare time I wanted to take it to the next level.
I had learned a lot through Google and some online courses, but learning didn't really go fast enough.
Furthermore, working and learning all by yourself is just very, very, boring.
Through word of mouth I heard about Codaisseur, I checked out their website and decided to give it a shot.
I quit my job and started the traineeship October 1st. It was a blast! Working and learning in a team is so much more awesome.
Throughout the weeks we learned a whole bunch. Starting with some basics, and ending with some pretty advanced stuff.
